This study looked at the recognition patterns of T-cell receptor epitopes using advanced machine-learning techniques.
We obtained a comprehensive collection of TCR sequences together with their corresponding epitopes, cases were
drawn from both humans and mouse. Through distance matrix calculations, dimensionality reduction techniques as well as
various classification algorithms our method uncovers patterns found in TCR-epitope interactions. Our method combines those
three elements to take away the benefits both of distance matrix calculations and dimensionality reduction techniques, reaping
its glorious fruit in various classification systems. In this way, the machine learning approach made its mark on the data
at last. The results show that machine learning methods can be good predictors of TCR specificity. Among these, k nearest
neighbours offer especially promising performance scores. This work contributes to our understanding of adaptive immunity
and has potential applications in immunotherapy and vaccine development.
